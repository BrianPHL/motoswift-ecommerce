## Technologies Used
| Category    | Technology                    | 
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| `Frontend`  | React.js with React Router    |
| `Backend`   | Express.js                    |
| `Database`  | MySQL (managed in phpmyadmin) |
| `Prototype` | Figma                         |

## Getting Started
### 1. Install Everything
Open a terminal and run:
```sh
npm install
```
### 2. Start the Project
Run this command to start both the frontend and backend:
```sh
npm run dev
```
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:3000
### 3. Done!
You can just open your browser and start exploring.

## Commands
| Command           | Description                    | 
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts the development environment for both the client and server.    |
| `npm run lint`    | Checks the code for linting errors using ESLint.                                                                   |
| `npm run build`    | Builds the production-ready frontend application. (No need for this since Railway will handle the build process.) |
| `npm run preview` | Previews the production build of the frontend locally.                                                             |

## Notes
### **Frontend**
The frontend code is located in the `client` folder. It is built using React to provide a responsive and dynamic user interface, with features like component-based architecture, routing, and API integration.

### **Backend**
The backend code is located in the `server` folder. It is built using Express.js to handle server-side logic, including RESTful APIs, middleware, and database interactions.

### **Database**
The project uses MySQL as the database, configured in the `config` folder. It stores and manages data for users, products, orders, and other entities.

### **Prototype**
The prototype for Motoswift E-Commerce was created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com), a collaborative interface design tool. It served as the foundation for the project's user interface and experience, ensuring a cohesive and user-friendly design.
